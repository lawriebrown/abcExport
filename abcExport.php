/*
 * abcExport MediaWiki extension 
 * @description provides support for exporting abc music notation
 * in mediawiki as a abc file or a rendered pdf score of the abc.
 *
 * This extension is most likely used along with the ABCjs extension
 * that supports input, tagging & display on abc music notation.
 *
 * To use this extension, unzip the extension code from abcExport.zip 
 * in your wiki extensions dir, creating directory extensions/abcExport
 *
 * To support pdf score rendering you need to have the abcm2ps & gs
 * programs installed on your system, with locations configured in globals.
 *
 * To enable this extension, include in your LocalSettings.php file:
 * wfLoadExtension('abcExport');
 *
 * You can then redefine any of the following globals as needed:
 * $wgabcExport_abcm2ps - full path to abcm2ps command (or null if missing)
 *    if set to null, pdf score export is not available, so option removed
 * $wgabcExport_gs - full path to gs command
 * $wgabcExport_abcTag - start tag for abc content (same as used in ABCjs)
 * $wgabcExport_abcTagEnd - end tag for abc content (same as used in ABCjs)
 * $wgabcExport_mungeNames - whether to munge tune names by moving any
 *    leading The/An/A to the end in brackets, per site policy
 * $wgabcExport_addFileURL - whether to add F: file URL tag to source page for
 *    tune to the exported abc (or generated PDF score)
 *
 * the following globals should be correctly defined automatically
 * $wgabcExport_haveSessMgr - true if using MW1.27+ with SessionManager to
 *    provide persistence for tune list & filename in web session

 * ePubExport extension, and subsequently rewritten using the cookiecutter
 * extension builder, and some ideas from the CiteThisPage extension.
 * Those contributions are gratefully acknowledged.
